# Files to create figure 4

This folder contains code to create figure 4, showing the geographic distribution of necrotic accessions and susceptible genotypes worldwide.

`fig4.R` creates the plot, and calls other scripts to create each subplot.

`test_spatial_dispersion.R` performs statistical tests for whether observed distances between pairs of necrotic accessions or between pairs of accessions with susceptible alleles are over- or underdispersed than would be expected by chance.
