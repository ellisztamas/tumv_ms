# Files to create figure 4

This folder contains code to create figure 4, showing the geographic distribution of necrotic accessions and susceptible genotypes worldwide.

The heavy lifting is done by scripts in `04_analyses/07_geographic_distribution/`.

`fig4.R` creates the plot, and calls other scripts to create each subplot.
