# Scripts to create figure 3

Code by Benjamin Jaegle, adapted by Tom Ellis for sharing

## Prerequisites

### BLAST software

Download `ncbi-blast-2.7.1+` from the NCBI website, and unpack it to `02_library`:
```
https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/doc/blast-help/downloadblastdata.html
```

### TAIR 10 genome

Download and the TAIR10 reference genome from:
```
https://www.arabidopsis.org/download/index-auto.jsp?dir=%2Fdownload_files%2FGenes%2FTAIR10_genome_release%2FTAIR10_chromosome_files
```

Unpack it to 01_data. The specific file needed is `TAIR10_chr_all.fas`

### Araport annotation

Download the Araport 11 annotation file an unzip it to `01_data`:
https://www.arabidopsis.org/download_files/Genes/Araport11_genome_release/Araport11_GFF3_genes_transposons.current.gff.gz

Note! The Araport file will likely have the date of download as part of the file
(e.g. `Araport11_GFF3_genes_transposons.May2023.gff`), which makes it difficult
to keep scripts reproducible. As a workaround, delete the date manually, so the
filename looks something like `Araport11_GFF3_genes_transposons.gff`.

## Scripts

There are five scripts to create the plot:

- `01_extract_bed.R` looks into the Araport 11 annotation of the reference
genome and creates a BED file for each annotated gene or feature.
- `02_prepare_fasta.sh` finds the sequences corresponding to six genes/TEs
on either side of AT2G14080 annotated in the reference genome.
- `03_blast_to_pacbio.sh` prepares a BLAST database for each PacBio genome and 
uses it to look for homology between genes/TE from the reference genome and each
 PacBio.
- `04_order_accessions.R`: To sanitise plotting, this creates a textfile of line
names ordering each PacBio by how large the space between AT2G14080 and
AT2G14120 is.
- `05_plotting.R` This plots (A) a close-up of the peak of association with
necrosis from figure 2 and (B) the structure of each PacBio genome around
AT2G14080 and AT2G14120.
